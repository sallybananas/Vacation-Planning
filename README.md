# GifTastic!

GifTastic! uses the Giphy API to find and display images related to any movie or TV show you like. Data attributes are used to keep track of multiple image versions within elements. jQuery is used for handling click events and switching data attributes. Bootstrap with a dark theme is used for styling.
